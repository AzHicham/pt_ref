# pt_ref [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/TeXitoi/pt_ref.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TeXitoi/pt_ref)

Explore the public transport referencial with a nice DSL.

This project is a little funny POC, but nothing really polished.

## Tutorial

First, you need a [NTFS dataset](https://github.com/CanalTP/navitia/blob/dev/documentation/ntfs/ntfs_fr.md). You can find NTFS dataset at the [navitia open databar](https://www.navitia.io/datasets). If you are in a hurry, get the [ÃŽle-de-France dataset (click on ntfs.zip)](https://navitia.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/fr-idf/table/?sort=type_file)

Unzip your dataset.

You need a [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) nightly toolchain.

```
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
$ rustup toolchain install nightly
```

Now, download and build pt_ref

```
$ git clone https://github.com/TeXitoi/pt_ref.git
$ cd pt_ref
$ cargo +nightly build --release
```

And now you can play with it. I like to use [rlwrap](https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap) but that's optional. I also redirect stdout to a file to not spam the terminal (with a `tail -f` on the file on another terminal).

```
$ rlwrap ./target/release/pt_ref ~/dev/run/navitia/data/fr-idf/ntfs/ > /tmp/pt_ref.log

```

On `/tmp/pt_ref.log`, you'll have the json of your queries.
